# IMDB Review Classification with Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying IMDB movie reviews into positive and negative sentiments. The goal is to develop a text classification system that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given movie review.
## Project Overview

The project uses the bag-of-words technique to convert textual data into a sparse matrix representation. This representation captures the occurrence of words in each review and forms the basis for feature extraction. The sparse matrix is then converted into tensors, which are compatible with deep learning models in the PyTorch framework.

For the initial implementation, a simple linear network is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The linear network is trained on a custom dataset, which is divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. Each set contains a collection of preprocessed IMDB movie reviews, labeled as positive or negative.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/your-username/IMDB-review-classification.git](https://github.com/mohammadr8za/Sentiment-Classifier.git)
* Install the required dependencies
* Train the model

## Results and Future Enhancements

The initial implementation using a simple linear network provides a baseline performance for sentiment classification on the IMDB movie review dataset. However, there are several avenues for enhancing the model's performance:

* Implement more advanced deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to capture sequential or spatial information in the text data.
* Experiment with different text preprocessing techniques, such as stemming, lemmatization, or removing stop words, to improve the quality of the input features.
* Explore the use of pre-trained word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, to capture semantic relationships between words more effectively.
* Fine-tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques, to optimize the model's performance.
* Increase the size of the training dataset or consider using data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.

By implementing these enhancements, the model's performance can potentially be improved, leading to more accurate sentiment classification of IMDB movie reviews.
